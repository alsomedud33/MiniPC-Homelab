Personal home lab using Proxmox, Jellyfin and Tailscale.

## üñ•Ô∏è Home Lab Setup: Proxmox, Jellyfin, NAS & Remote Access via Tailscale

### üìå Overview
![HomeLab Setup](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebf81ac7-51eb-4ead-8083-9be0c25b8957)
This project is a documention of the setup for my personal home lab using a miniPC and Proxmox VE. My goal was to gain hands-on experience with virtualization, containerization, and self-hosted services while building a functional environment that could act as a LAN-accessible NAS and media server with secure external access.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Summary
1. **Installing Proxmox VE**

    Flashed Proxmox VE ISO onto a USB using Rufus.

    Installed Proxmox onto the miniPC and accessed the web UI from a browser over my Local Network.

    Created a local storage pool for containers and ISOs.
   
3. **Creating Containers**

    Created an LXC container running Debian.

    Installed basic packages (curl, sudo, nano, etc.).

    Configured static IP for easier LAN access.
4. **Setting up Jellyfin**

    I installed Jellyfin inside the container via official repositories.

    Mounted media directories from the host storage.

    Accessed Jellyfin via local IP and completed the default setup process.
5. **Creating a LAN NAS**

    Configured a shared folder on the host using Samba.

    Made it accessible over the network to Windows and Linux devices.

    Set read/write permissions based on use case.
6. **Enabling Remote Access with Tailscale**

    Installed Tailscale inside a container.

    Linked the container to my Tailscale account using tailscale up.

    Verified access from my phone and other devices outside the LAN.

    Secured access using ACLs and Tailscale admin console.

### üîí Security Considerations

    Used limited-scope containers and strong passwords.

    Disabled unused services.

    Avoided port forwarding in favour of encrypted peer-to-peer access with Tailscale.

    Plan to implement fail2ban and local backups in future iterations.
---
### üí° Lessons Learned

    Setting up and maintaining a self-hosted environment builds a deeper understanding of networking, storage, and Linux systems.

    Tailscale simplifies secure external access without needing complex firewall or VPN configs.

    Proxmox is a powerful and user-friendly hypervisor that bridges the gap between personal projects and enterprise tools.

### üì∑ Screenshots (Optional)

(Include screenshots of your Proxmox dashboard, Jellyfin UI, and Tailscale access map here if desired)

### üöÄ Future Plans

    Add Docker or Portainer for more container management options.

    Set up a monitoring stack (e.g., Grafana + Prometheus).

    Expand storage with an external drive and explore ZFS.
